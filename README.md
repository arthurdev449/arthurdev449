# Hi there, I'm Arthur! 👋

I'm a 3rd-semester Computer Science student at UNICID (Universidade Cidade de São Paulo) with a passion for building practical software solutions and continuously learning new technologies. I'm driven by a desire to understand how technology can solve real-world problems and I'm eager to contribute to impactful projects.

My previous internship at **Limitless School** provided me with fantastic hands-on experience, from developing the company's first website from scratch (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to supporting diverse IT operations. This experience solidified my love for the development lifecycle and practical problem-solving.

As a dual Brazilian-Australian citizen, I'm fluent in both Portuguese and English, bringing a diverse perspective to collaborative environments.
